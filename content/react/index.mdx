## Quick Start

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```

## Adding styles

In React, you specify a CSS class with className. It works the same way as the HTML class attribute:

```jsx
<img className="avatar" />
```
